Bachelor paper topic:
    Postal Appointments Application

Description of the problem:
    Clients should be able to create appointments, but they should not know exactly how the process is done;
    the complexity of the creation process should be hidden. Objects should be referenced through a common
    interface. In order to create an appointment the name, tracking number and date are mandatory, but a user
    could also specify a desired hour and a particular postal office from which to pick up their parcel.

Advantages:
    - objects do not need to have all characteristics in order to be created
    - all objects are created through a common interface
    - offers flexibility to users as they choose which components to create in the objects

Disadvantages:
    - attributes can be forgotten when creating an object
