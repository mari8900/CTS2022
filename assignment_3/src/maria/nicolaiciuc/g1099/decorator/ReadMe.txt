Bachelor paper topic:
    Postal Appointments Application

Description of the problem:
    When creating an appointment and using one of its methods, we want to decorate it with a color, so users
    have a better visual understanding, without modifying the original code of the appointment class. 
    Appointment created will be colored green, and appointment updated will be colored red.
     
Advantages:
    - expanding the functionalities of an object
    - no limits imposed to the number of maximum decorations that can be applied to an object

Disadvantages:
    - the decorator is just a wrapper, so its not identical to the encapsulated object
    - excessive use of the decorator can generate many objects that look the same but act different
