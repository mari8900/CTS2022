Bachelor paper topic:
    Postal Appointments Application

Description of the problem:
    Instead of losing time when creating new appointments, we can reduce the waiting time by using
    the clone method, thus reusing the same objects created before.
     
Advantages:
    - we avoid the call of the constructor
    - we can create identical objects (if needed) easier and quicker

Disadvantages:
    - shallow copies could be created if dynamic fields are not copied correctly
